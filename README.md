# NBC
Code from Experiments in the North Branch of the Chicago River

NBCcode.R contains all the preliminary code for calculations and visualization.  Data files have NOT been included in this repository yet.

This is a work in progress and will be updated irregularly as processes are completed.  I hope to make a pretty, interactive, interface for this project one day.


I am self-taught in R, so I am somewhat inconsistent in the approaches I use here.  I am actively improving my use of github  and in-document annotation to try and make these files hopefully usable to someone!


Please don't steal my work....
